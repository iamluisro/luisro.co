For a more detailed description of why I decided to build my personal website instead of using something like wordpress, squarespace or webflow, check out this other post. </p>\n<h1>What I was going to build</h1>\n<p>I thought about what my personal website needed to do and I determined I wanted it to host my blog and be a portfolio of work and projects I've done. Additionally, the site needed to be responsive for both mobile and desktop and a fast experience for my users. Finally, I was going to take a \"mobiel first\" approach and design the site thinking proimarily of mobile users. </p>\n<p>In a bullet point list I wanted: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Host Blog</li>\n<li>Host Portfolio of work</li>\n<li>Be fast</li>\n<li>Be responsive for mobile and desktop </li>\n<li>Needs to be in English and Spanish </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once I established what I was going to build, I wanted to figure out how the site would look like to understand a little better what I needed to make it work. </p>\n<p>So, I drew it. I drew the site first to have a basic idea of what tools and resources I needed. I wasn't gong to complicate things either. This was the first site I built entirely from sratch. </p>\n<p>Once I drew the site (I'll try to find an img and post it), I used Figma to create a mockup of the site. That mockup was the first mockup I created and <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/proto/XFuzdnffJ2I0t8nrnA79Ag/luisro.co?node-id=40%3A57&#x26;viewport=-222%2C399%2C0.20008079707622528&#x26;scaling=min-zoom\" title=\"Figma MockUp\">looked like this</a>. </p>\n<p>This is by no means the fanciest thing I've built on Figma. Remember it was my first stab at Figma! Anyways, once I saw what I wanted to build I made a list of the containers/pages and components I needed to build. </p>\n<h1>The stack</h1>\n<p>I had done some previous projects with React.js and Gatsby.js, so I decided to use these frameworks again. The Gatsby framework allowed a static site like my own to be lightning fast, satisfying one of the first requirements of the project. Gatsby also has the plus of allowing me to use GraphQL which I found very amazing to use. </p>\n<p>From a CSS standpoint, I wanted to learn how to use Styled Components so I decided to use this particular CSS framework. </p>\n<p>Next, I needed to figure out how to host content on my site. The simplest thing I could've done was to use was to create the posts on my repo but I wanted to have the experience of using a headless CMS and found the Contentful to be very intuitive (bonus points to Gatsby for also having great documentation on implementing Contentful). So, I'm currently writing this post on Contentful. </p>\n<p>Finally, I needed to find somewhere to host this thing. After experience with zeit/now and Firebase, I decided to continue on the serverless trend and use another service called Netlify. </p>\n<h1>The result</h1>\n<p>This is what the site now looks like and you'd know, you're on it. </p>\n<p>It took me about a month to really get all the pieces together and considering it was my first time creating a site from scratch, I'm fairly happy with my result. Then, like any good project, procrastination happens and I didn't touch the site again for 3 months. </p>\n<p>Now that 3 months have passed, I'm happy with the result and will continue adding more projects onto the site as well as more thoughts and continual updates to the site itself. </p>\n<p>I did take a screenshot of the audit test for desktop and this is the result as of Friday, Dec 13, 2019:\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/n4tz31ybush2/6ouzIywbfKjffhZWeCczqe/d7f5180b901c3a3bd72ef54fb7b83462/Screen_Shot_2019-12-13_at_5.56.29_PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-12-13 at 5.56.29 PM\"></p>\n<h1>Upcoming updates</h1>\n<p>Some of the updates I'd like to see and work on are: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make the site able to change from English to Spanish. </li>\n<li>Create \"tag pages\" so I can display all posts with the same tag in a page. </li>\n<li>Refactor the CSS code. The first go was a bit sloppy and I know I can make it cleaner. </li>\n<li>Add some CSS animation to the home page, possibly my profile picture. </li>\n<li>Add Google Analytics. </li>\n<li>Make the site 100% a PWA. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>And that's it! Thanks for reading, and I hope you stick around to read other projects I've worked on and my thoughts. </p>\n<p>You can view my <a href=\"https://github.com/iamluisro/luisro.co\" title=\"https://github.com/iamluisro/luisro.co\">site's repo by clicking here. </a>\nYou can also follow me on social networks here: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/luis_rodriguez\" title=\"Twitter Luis Rodriguez\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamluisro\" title=\"LinkedIn Luis Rodriguez\">LinkedIn</a>. </p>"}
