I know I do. But it’s hard. I should choose maybe two or three topics to write about but again, that’s hard. I don’t feel like I’ve quite found my niche. </p>\n<p>My niche used to be community… and I didn’t write about it back then. I used to do operations for Community programs but I didn’t write about it back then. Maybe I can write a couple of learnings from back in the day. I still need to write my learnings from my UP Global and TS days. Maybe I’ll actually sit down and write these learnings. Maybe not. Not sure yet. </p>\n<p>What am I sure about? Not much. </p>\n<p>“The only thing I know is that I know nothing.” Maybe I’m too humble and I should brag more about what I know. But then I go into the rabbit hole of “what is it I even know”? This is too complicated. I know I should write, but I don’t know what to write about. </p>\n<p>In any case, I could start writing about something and then I’d lose interest on it… or maybe I don’t feel like I’ve got the authority to write on the subject. I know I’m a hypocrite though. I’d tell anyone else in a heartbeat to write what they believed in and not worry about their own thoughts or if they’re a domain authority or not. I’d tell them to write. The authority would come with the pieces of writing. </p>\n<p>I should just publish this piece just so I can say I finally published something again. I don’t want to take forever to write pieces. I also need to write in Spanish… I do believe I’d have a better chance of reaching more folks and maybe helping them on their journey. </p>\n<p>Anyways, it’s 1:01 now. I’ll head off to bed now. I’ve got a long day ahead where I need to be at the office at 11am, then have a meeting about another project we’re working on and finally, I need to return the modem from the internet provider we just cancelled from our recent apartment move. </p>\n<p>I’ll keep writing posts on this blog. I know I need to get these thoughts out of my head and onto the web, but it’s taken some time to rebuild myself from past experiences. I’ll get back at it. </p>"}
