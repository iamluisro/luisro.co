Specify a URL, configure your webhook, and we will send an HTTP POST request whenever something happens to your content.</p>\n<h2>How do I configure a webhook?</h2>\n<p>Go to Settings â†’ Webhooks from the navigation bar at the top. From there, hit Add webhook, and you will be directed to your new webhook. Then choose a name, put in the information of your HTTP endpoint (URL and authentication), specify any custom headers and select the types of events that should trigger the webhook.</p>\n<h2>Why do I get an old version in the CDA?</h2>\n<p>As the delivery API is powered by a CDN network consisting of hundreds of servers distributed across continents, it takes some time (up to a few minutes) to reflect the changes to the published content. This must be taken into consideration when reacting to webhooks. In normal conditions, there could be a reasonable delay of 2 to 5 minutes.</p>\n<p>Extracted from the <a href=\"https://www.contentful.com/faq/webhooks/\" title=\"Webhooks FAQ\">Webhooks FAQ</a>.</p>"}},"heroImage":{"fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/n4tz31ybush2/4shwYI3POEGkw0Eg6kcyaQ/61296ffb0a821355f17301252a93d335/felix-russell-saw-112140.jpg?w=800&q=50"},"description":"Tattooed man walking in a field"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"automate-with-webhooks","previous":{"title":"Static sites are great","id":"977bbcc5-6d12-5964-9d85-b4abf37b57d9","slug":"static-sites-are-great"},"next":{"title":"Hello world","id":"aa7f37c3-955c-5d5e-9024-0b7e98684e23","slug":"hello-world"}}}}
