I was in touch with our customers almost 24/7. I understood their struggles, what they thought when they used our product and the frustrations they had because of the product and the team. There were also times I created supporting materials and global processes like setting up NPS Surveys for 1000+ events and for almost 100k users, oh, and on a budget too. </p>\n<p>After a couple of years in the Operations team, I found data. I learned how to get it, how to read it, how to transform it. And I became a Data Analyst. So now I had data and could put systems in place to better understand performace through a \"data analytics\" lense. </p>\n<p>Then I ran into \"Product\". I always knew what we were doing had value... our mission was one I resonated with and had global impact. But I hadn't thought about our value offering as a \"product\". Once I discovered the world of \"Product Management\", I knew this was the area I wanted to understand in-depth and provide value in. </p>\n<p>Something else that really sunk in was the value of software. There were many things I saw where my gut told me the right move was to create a software solution. When I couldn't get this software solution built due to external forces, I was left with a decision to make. </p>\n<p>I knew I wanted to continue pursuing product management. I wanted to learn how to build a software product. But I knew this was sohing I couldn't accomplish where I was at. My decision was to continue learning product management... but through learning to write and build software. </p>\n<p>So I decided to learn how to code. </p>\n<p>I quit my job to learn how to code. I've been studying through online tutorials and using tools like Platzi and their program \"Escuela de JavaScript\" aka \"JavaScript school\". </p>\n<p>I've learned a handful on how to write user stories, conduct customer interviews and even got a taste of managing company politics, though I won't say I'm 100% proficient on this last one just yet. Nevertheless, I'm doing what I wanted to do back then: building software. </p>\n<p>Though I'm starting out small, I have learned rapidly how to create a simple static site and a small web application. </p>\n<p>Currently I'm working on building a bunch of things: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fenix: A solution for businesses looking to provide a holistic and integral training and development for their employees.</li>\n<li>MujeresLatam: A platform aimed at helping women in tech and entrepreneurship in Latam connect with each other.</li>\n<li>CachorroStays: An Airbnb for dog hotels. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>I do all of these with my business and partner, Gisse Peralta. We work together to help build these projects and help other companies through our services. </p>\n<p>So now I code. And although I still have a lot to learn on best practices and working with high-performing dev teams, I'm closer to my goals than ever before. </p>\n<p>I hope you follow me on my journey by checking in on this blog every now and then, or through <a href=\"http://twitter.com/luis_rodriguez\" title=\"http://twitter.com/luis_rodriguez\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamluisro/\" title=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamluisro/\">LinkedIn</a> or <a href=\"https://www.github.com/iamluisro\" title=\"https://www.github.com/iamluisro\">Github</a>.</p>"}},"heroImage":{"fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/n4tz31ybush2/1O8KOd0S3R0yb82Er9CJuC/ad8b17cdd59ae7d938c7a5581aee4ad9/ilya-pavlov-OqtafYT5kTw-unsplash-min.jpg?w=800&q=50"},"description":""}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"why-i-decided-to-start-coding","previous":{"title":"Hello world","id":"7422f786-a28d-52fe-9da8-ad6b2972f65a","slug":"hello-world"},"next":{"title":"Â¡Canta y no llores, mis Chivas!","id":"e573255f-3c55-5bbb-9b86-7d5bc08e269a","slug":"chivas-post1"}}}}
